😃 Welcome to my personal page!

I am Tianqi Liu (**刘天齐** in Chinese), a third-year (2023.09-) master's student in Artificial Intelligence at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), supervised by Prof. [Zhiguo Cao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=396o2BAAAAAJ&hl=en). I was fortunate to have worked as a research assistant at [MMLAB@NTU](https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/), advised by Prof. [Ziwei Liu](https://liuziwei7.github.io/). Before that, I received my bachelor’s degree from HUST in 2023.  My current research interests include 3D/4D generation and reconstruction.
